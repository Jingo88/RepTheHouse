# Rep The House

**Rep The House** is a political web application. Its purpose is to provide it's users easier access to information on the current legislators in the United States House of Representatives. The current APIs allow us to filter through information with regards to the current bills legislators are sponsoring, and the donations they have received. 

This web application is a single page app that which makes AJAX requests to two two seperate APIs using an Express.js server. I used vanilla JavaScript to manipulate the JSON data from the API calls, then used EJS templating to render the information. The bubble chart is being created using D3.js. The styling was done with CSS and Bootstrap.
